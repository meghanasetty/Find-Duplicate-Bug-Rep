# Finding-Duplicate-Bug-Reports
### Performance Optimization of Finding Duplicate Bug Reports
Developed models for CPU and GPU versions for finding the duplicate bug reports of Eclipse Dataset. Improved the performance of both the versions using different strategies like loop unrolling, using vector instructions (intel intrinsic), caching, GPU streams, on Xeon E5-2667 v3 which uses Haswell Architecture.
